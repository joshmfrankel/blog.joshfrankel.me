The current development version of Modernizr does not contain the yepnope.js bundle.  This is somewhat tricky as there is no error message or notification except in the console debugger.

<pre class="lang:js" title="Console output">
Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'load'
</pre>

Luckily, there is an easy fix for this.  Just download the production version and make sure to mark the checkbox called Modernizr.load(yepnope).  Fixed!
