<p>When I was in college learning about web development back in 2005 (yeesh), I was always looking for the perfect method of programming. My young and naive mind thought "if I can only find the perfect way of doing this, I'll never have to learn it again". Of course with web development and life, perfection should only ever be a direction not a goal.</p>

<p>If you have ever seen the movie Fight Club, there is a scene in which the narrator lists all the recently destroyed things in his apartment to his friend, Tyler. Furniture, rugs, kitchenware, a Yin-Yang table. He says "I was close to being complete.". A little while later Tyler responds, "...I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... lets evolve...". The point being that not constraining yourself to perfection allows for some powerful growth and evolving of your process.</p>

<h3>Have the courage to shred your process</h3>
<p>Did you just learn about css pre-processors? Are you using object oriented programming? That's awesome... now find another technique and integrate it. Too many times in the past have I talked to developers who are afraid of changing their process.</p>
<p>Every project I work on I try a new process or skill. Not having fear of trying a technique allows you to continuously grow as a professional. This will not only keep you up to date on the latest technological advances, but will also keep you interested and not complacent with your current skills.</p>
<p>Another benefit to this approach is it keeps you constantly marketable. Would you rather hire the developer who has been using the same process since 1999 or the one who just evolved his further? Employers view this as a serious limitation in terms of overall knowledge and web competency.</p>

<h3>Work smarter not harder</h3>
<p>The Pareto principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the actions. By taking the line of thinking you can safely eliminate a lot of learning that has already been done for you. This comes in the handy form of plugins, frameworks, and <a href="www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>.</p>
<p>These were built because somebody somewhere thought, "if only there was an easier way". Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel in these scenarios finding a solution that exists and is flexible allows you to focus on higher level problem solving instead of getting distracted with the small details. This allows you to focus on the 20%.</p>

    <p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Focus on the high level problem and utilize existing solutions from the community to reduce distractions.</p>

<h3>Learn about your tools</h3>
<p>Probably the most important tool in your arsenal is the text editor. But how much do you really know about your text editor? Can it do version control or unit testing without the command line? Can it write custom macros or scripts to automate common tasks?</p>
<p>Learning the inner workings of this tool can lead to some drastic changes in process. For example I use Sublime Text religiously as my text editor of choice. A while back I received a file that had converted 4 spaces to 2 tabs. Since this would have made version control throw a fit, I decided to write a simple macro to convert tabs into spaces and then down to 4 spaces. I can now reuse this bit of code with my editor anytime I happen upon this problem.</p>
<p>This was all possible from reading and learning some of the behind the curtain actions my editor was taking. It also helped me to understand more about the syntax and settings that were the editor defaults. By learning the tool I had drastically reduced the amount of effort I would need in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Understand how to leverage the tools you use for further productivity</p>

<h3>Only use resources to add value</h3>
<p>I took this method from Toyota's Lean Manufacturing which states that, "...the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful...". The work you are doing should always add value to the product. If what you are doing isn't adding any end value then it may be time to reevaluate why it is necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to only adding value the second part of this is reduction of steps to accomplish an action. Try thinking about how many keystrokes it can take to build a webpage. Now multiply those by how many projects you do in a year. If you can reduce the keystrokes in your process even by 5, think how much time you would have saved over the entire year. This segues into my last point.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Method 4: </strong>Create things that only add value to the end product, not fluff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Automate everything! Let the machines rule</h3>
<p>The more things you can automate the less work you end up having to do. In addition to automating everything you give your brain a break allowing it to focus on more pertinent tasks. Are you manually compressing and concatenating your javascript files? Why not try using Guard or Grunt to automatically do it for you? Are you using git on a dev site but don't want to manually do <code>git pull</code> on the live site? These are just examples of things that can be done to help make your process take less steps.</p>

    <p><strong>Method 5: </strong>Automate your workflow as much as possible to free up brain power.</p>
