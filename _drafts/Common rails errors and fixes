Common rails errors and fixes

# Rails server pid
Sometimes rails server doesn't unlock its process id. Manually remove it to fix it.
A server is already running. Check /Users/jfrankel/Rails/sourcing/tmp/pids/server.pid.

# Address already in use
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server

/Users/jfrankel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/2.2.0/socket.rb:206:in `bind': Address already in use - bind(2) for 127.0.0.1:3000 (Errno::EADDRINUSE)

The port for your local development server is still being used by a ruby process. Assuming you are using the default port of 3000 run the following command to retrieve a list of all processes using the port.

lsof -wni tcp:3000

SHould get something like

COMMAND   PID     USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ruby    41704 jfrankel   12u  IPv6 0xf3fe9a8ff1e035b9      0t0  TCP [::1]:hbci (LISTEN)
ruby    41704 jfrankel   13u  IPv4 0xf3fe9a8ff6649a29      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:hbci (LISTEN)

Next just kill the process based on the pid.

kill -9 41704
