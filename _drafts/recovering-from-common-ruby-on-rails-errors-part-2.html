<h2 id="6">LoadError expected something to define it</h2>
{% highlight bash %}
LoadError at /awards/11
Unable to autoload constant AwardSupplierNotificationSettings, expected /Users/jfrankel/Rails/sourcing/app/models/award_supplier_notification_settings.rb to define it
{% endhighlight %}

Basically this is similiar to the above NameError. This usually means that a class name is incorrectly typed.

<h2 id="7">PG::ObjectInUse: ERROR:  database "myapp_development" is being accessed by other users</h2>
Rake db:drop or other databse actions
{% highlight bash %}
PG::ObjectInUse: ERROR:  database "myapp_development" is being accessed by other users
DETAIL:  There is 1 other session using the database.
: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "myapp_development"
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure all connections to the database are closed
Make sure all pgsql admin connections are closed

<h2 id="8">Could not find [gem name] in any of the sources</h2>

Could not find in sources errors generally deal with the Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, improper bundler usage, or misconfigured installation.

1. Revert to a clean state in your repository
2. Remove [gem name] from Gemfile
3. Run bundle (not update)
4. Look in your Gemfile.lock and see what is depending upon [gem name]

Turn off all rails server and guard instances
rails g rspec:install
regenerate guard
remove Gemfile.lock

<h2 id="9">Databse keeps truncating after running guard-rspec</h2>
You most likely


<h2 id="10">Stack Level Too Deep</h2>
<p>One of your methods is performing an infinite recursive call which is timing out the application's execution. Make sure if you are doing recursion that there is a stopping condition. Otherwise you have a method potentially calling itself incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="11">DoubleRenderError</h2>
<p>Redirect or render twice in single controller action</p>
