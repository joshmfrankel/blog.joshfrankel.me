Sorting objects in JavaScript isn't exactly intuitive at first glance. Sorting objects
by values is a little more complex. And sorting objects based on specific criteria
where some values can be null is tricky to say the least.

Recently, a colleague and I ran into a specific use case where we needed to sort
the same collection of objects in two seperate ways.

Let's talk about the data we're working with. We have an ActiveRecord collection
for a few user Assignments. Each Assignment has a specific progress associated
with it (for tracking where a user's status is currently).

{% highlight ruby %}

getIncompleteAssignments() {
  return this.getAllIncompleAssignments()
    .filter(a => a.progress.dueDate)
    .sort(this.sortByProgressKey('dueDate'))
    .concat(
      this.getAllIncompleAssignments()
        .filter(a => !a.progress.dueDate)
        .sort(this.sortByProgressKey('assignedAt', true))
    );
}

sortByProgressKey(key, reverse = false) {
  return (current, next) => {
    if (_.isNull(current.progress[key]) || _.isNull(next.progress[key])) {
      return 1;
    } else if (current.progress[key] === next.progress[key]) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      comparison = current.progress[key] - next.progress[key];
      return reverse ? comparison * -1 : comparison;
    }
  };
}
