<p>I recently read a blog post by Avdi Grimm about a setting realistic expectations for a programming language roadmap. While there are a ton of languages I would love to learn I had to split them into groups of priority.</p>

<h3>Start Learning</h3>
<p>These are the priority languages to start using or learning for my roadmap.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ember.js: because I've used Angular a bit and Ember.js seems to integrate better with the Rails environment.</li>
    <li>Mongodb: because I already know a lot about relational database structures and could learn some NoSQL</li>
    <li>Java or C#: I've used both in the past but could brush up on my compiled language skills.</li>
    <li>Docker: a little more dev ops knowledge couldn't hurt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backburner</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Meteor.js: I love how this uses node.js. Ember.js is just a bit more important than Meteor</li>
    <li>Haskell: because every programmer I've talked to says it will expand your logic solving skills</li>
    <li>Rust: along the same lines as Haskell for expanding my mind</li>
    <li>Phaser.io: because I have always wanted to program a great Shmup game.</li>
    <li>Vala: because I love the Elementary OS platform and would like to give back to the community with some apps</li>
    <li>Scala: because I hear it is the great language to learn.</li>
</ul>
