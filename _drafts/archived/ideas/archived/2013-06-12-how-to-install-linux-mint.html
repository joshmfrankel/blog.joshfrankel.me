As a web developer coming from a background of using the Windows OS, I noticed that terminal is used frequently for setting up code environments (Ruby on Rails) and running apps such as LiveReload. While their are Windows alternatives, they require a specific setup to work from command line and this just felt like a smelly workaround. While Mac OSX has this built-in, I didn't really want to drop two grand on an apple product when using Linux would accomplish the same functionality at the low price of free.

So I tried out a couple different Linux distros and determined which ones would suite my process the best. The two I liked the most were Ubuntu and Linux Mint (haven't tried ArchLinux but lots of people swear by it). After much debate between the two (technically Linux Mint is based directly off Ubuntu) I decided that Linux Mint was more efficient.

I spent a couple weeks trying to create a perfect linux environment. After many failures, I recorded the process step-by-step. So let's start with what you need.
<h3>What you Need</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A Flash drive with at least a 1GB capacity</li>
	<li>A Laptop</li>
	<li>*** ONLY FOR OPTIMUS VIDEO CARDS *** A Mini DisplayPort to HDMI converting adapter (more on this later)</li>
</ol>
This guide is written for a Dell XPS 15 L502X with a Nvidia 525M discrete video card with Optimus Technology. It is important to note that the brand of laptop and its hardware directly effect how to setup specific features in linux however, this guide should work for most devices. An issue that will be addressed later are laptops with an integrated video card and an Nvidia Optimus video card in them.
<blockquote><strong>Quick Note: </strong>Nvidia created a technology referred to as Optimus that switches between the integrated card and the discrete card on the fly. This allows for lower power consumption and when needed extra performance. However, Optimus cards are not supported out of the box on Linux.</blockquote>
<h3>Create a Bootable USB Installer</h3>
The first step is to download the Linux Mint 13 DVD ISO Cinnamon edition. You can do this directly from the <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/release.php?id=18">Linux Mint 13 Downloads</a>. Â Make sure you choose Cinnamon (64-bit) and not any of the others. don't get the ones saying "no-codecs"

While we are waiting on the download to complete lets grab an excellent little program called <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">USB Universal Installer</a>. This will help us to create a bootable Linux Mint disc on a flash drive.
<div class="step-by-step" id="usb-universal-installer">
<div class="step-single">

1. Choose the distro of linux you wish to install

2. Select the iso location and install to usb

3. Get yourself a beer, while we wait.

<h3>Install Linux Mint</h3>
So first plug the newly created usb installer into a free port and restart your computer. While the computer starts up, press F12 or F8 (your bios screen should display what key needs to be pressed) to get to the screen that allows you to boot from a device. Select the USB Device and Linux Mint will begin to load.

Unlike Windows, you will not be prompted to install the operating system yet.  Instead, Mint will load the live desktop mode which will allow you try out the fully featured operating system straight from the USB drive. This is awesome for testing out a distro to see how it works before installing it.

For the purpose of this guide we like Linux Mint and would like to install it. Double click the disc icon on the desktop that says Install Linux Mint. This will start up the installer.  Go through the next couple screens; choosing language, etc, until you get to the "Installation Type" screen.

<h4>Partitions & Dual boot</h4>
If you are only wishing to install one operating system then the next step is easy.  Just choose the Erase disk and install Linux Mint.  This will setup the hard drive with the correct partitions.

Otherwise, if you wish to run Linux Mint alongside Windows then you have two options.  Use the built in option of Install alongside Windows or manually configure the disk partitions.
<blockquote>For Dual booting Windows and Linux Mint <strong>Always</strong> install Windows first.  This will allow for Linux's grub menu to control how the two os's are booted.  Also it will reduce a lot of issues with dual booting</blockquote>

<h3>Post-Installation</h3>
Once we are done with the install lets run the following command in our fancy new console.
<code>sudo apt-get update</code>
This will update all of our currently installed packages to their newest versions. This is important since we are installing Linux Mint 13 not 14 so there may be lots of updates.

<h3>Optimus meet Bumblebee</h3>
This next section is only applicable if you own one of the aforementioned laptops with both an integrated and Nvidia Optimus video card. <strong>ONLY DO THIS FOR OPTIMUS LAPTOPS!</strong> Since Nvidia doesn't directly support Linux drivers we will use a community build workaround aptly named Bumblebee. This will allow us to utilize our discrete video card in Linux and enable the power savings feature for Optimus.
<blockquote>Even if you don't care about using it installing Bumblebee will dramatically increase your battery life. I went from one hour and fifty-eight minutes to three hours and 20 minutes on a fully charged battery. That's about a 43% increase in battery life.</blockquote>
The best guide to use for installing bumblebee comes from the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee">Ubuntu Wiki page</a>. Run each of these console commands in order (ignore the // lines).
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true" title="Console Commands for Bumblebee Install">// Adds the repo for bumblebee
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable

// Update all packages (will include the above repo)
sudo apt-get update

// Install Bumblebee
sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic</pre>
Once complete restart your system. We need to check and see if Bumblebee installed correctly. To test this run `glxspheres` in a console window for a couple seconds, then press ctrl+C to quit. Note the amount of fps you received. Now run `optirun glxspheres` in console for a couple second and like before check the amount of fps. You should see a large increase. Mine went from 50fps to around 116fps. If at any time you receive an error check the github page for Bumblebee as it contains a list of common errors. Otherwise, congratulations installing Bumblebee is the most difficult portion of this guide.
<h3>Upgrade to Linux Mint 14?</h3>
Now you may have wondered why we decided to use Linux Mint 13 over the newly release 14. Well there are a few reasons. For one Linux Mint 13 is a <abbr title="Long-term Support">LTS</abbr> release so we know that at least until 2017 there will be fixes. Another reason is the previous section on Bumblebee install is impossible from everything I tried on a Linux Mint 14 system.

Don't worry though we are going to get the best of both worlds. Linux Mint has conveniently enabled backporting for all the new 14 features into Linux Mint 13. Follow these steps to enable backporting.
<ul>
	<li>Go to Software Sources in the menu</li>
	<li>Click the checkbox for Backported Packages</li>
	<li>Launch the Update Manager</li>
	<li>Make sure all level 1 and level 2 updates are selected</li>
	<li>Install and restart</li>
</ul>
This process is described on the <a href="http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2225">Linux Mint blog</a>.

Now check a couple apps and make sure we didn't break anything. If you install Bumblebee make sure to run optirun glxspheres again. If you have no errors at this point the rest is downhill.
<h3>Install some apps</h3>
We can now install some apps from the awesome software manager program. Just open and search for the app's name. The following are a list of apps that are extremely useful.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Yakuake</strong> - A dropdown console similar to old first-person shooter games</li>
	<li><strong>BleachBit</strong> - The Linux version of CCLeaner</li>
	<li><strong>Wine</strong> - A Windows integration layer for running Windows applications inside Linux</li>
</ul>
The next series of apps I would install from their respective websites. For some reason they don't seem as updated in the software manager.
<ul>
	<li>Dropbox</li>
	<li>Google Chrome</li>
</ul>
The last series of apps we will install directly from the console.
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Keepass</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true" title="Install Keepass2 for Ubuntu">sudo apt-add-repository ppa:jtaylor/keepass
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install keepass2
sudo apt-get install xdotool</pre>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Git and cURL</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true" title="Git &amp; cURL">sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install curl</pre>
