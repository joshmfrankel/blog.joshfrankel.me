title: "Coding in Compassion: A Critiquing in Love story"

Story
A while back in my career as a developer, I was working on a large project in language I had only used briefly. I was deep in the codebase and feeling a bit overwhelmed. This didn't stop me as I like a good challenge.

As I finished up my part of the project, I looked over my newly gleaming code multiple times and finally sent it off for review. After a brief time interval, I received the following feedback from a colleage as part of the review, "Did you test it?". Nothing feels more like a hit to the gut like this phrase. Developers are frequently operate on the idea of writing code that is highly efficient and well structured, as well as, tested. Being new to the language I wasn't able to see all the pitfalls related to that portion of code.

As I continued looking through my review the next bit of language came up, "This will never work". Nothing kills motivation like insensitivity involving your professional skillset. Needless to say I had to take a long break before coming back to my desk. This situation is actually quite common in the development world and professional community.

## Caustic Critique
I like to refer to this as a caustic critique (patent pending). Anything that intentionally, or unintentionally, cuts down, insults a teammates skillset, or personally attacks a developer instead of the problem falls into this category.

This isn't to say that as a developer you shouldn't develop a thick skin, but the way in which you critique and give feedback to co-workers determines the quality of how well a team works together. This is important in any area of expertise but especially important with computer related jobs. Just because I work facing a computer all day, doesn't mean that I should communicate to my colleagues in the same format. In fact if you said ctrl+alt+delete and then walked away from a conversation from your boss this probably wouldn't go over well.

Jokes aside, compassion and empathy play into have effective conversations with teammates. They also lead to a happier more efficient team. This is referred to as "Critiquing in Love" by the Lesson.ly team, something that I like to call Coding with Compassion in the development world.

## What is Critiquing in Love?

So what exactly does it mean to Critique in Love? Well the basis of critiquing in love is to be constructive with feedback, encourage and create growth in your team, and communicate with respect and compassion. These three elements give a professional process for helping your team grow.

Critiquing in love
Coding with compassion make for happy developers, happy employers, and happy reusable code.

Coding with compassion means the following things:
Offering constructive critism and feedback to colleagues
Writing code in language and meaningful way so that other colleagues can jump into it quickly and start working
Making your goal to not only better your own skillset but the skillset of those around you. (The stronger your colleagues on your team the better products that you can produce).

As a developer, and also applicable to all employees, bettering my skillset requires a lot of hard work. Reading documentation,




As a developer, and also as an employee of a company,



In the business world, we all eventually have to present differing or even unpopular opinions regarding product roadmaps. This typically happens with one person throwing out an idea and other discussing. Sometimes these discussions can turn into critism and this is where innovation dies.

Critizing ideas for their lack of validity or usefullness create an environment where ideas have to be solid. As, a developer (and really this could be for any disipline), I frequently find myself writing code (crazy I know). Much of this code is comes from my experiences and previous knowledge. At Lesson.ly, we each review each other's code when it is ready for production. The easy route for the reviewer would be to dismiss parts of it as being subpar or unworkable. Comments such as "did you test it?" breed an environment

Critiquing in love is how I learned to be a better developer.




Notes
We critique in love.

Your teammates are trying their hardest to go from good to great.

There is nothing shameful about making mistakes; there is plenty of shame in avoiding them at all costs.

The alternative approach, where cutting people down is the norm, ensures that people stop sharing before they are ready.
