## How To

Red - Green - Refactor

Spike - Red - Green - Refactor

## Stages of a good test

* Setup
* Behavior
* Verifiy (expectation)
* Teardown

## Code Smells
Not hard and fast rules just can impair readability
Sometimes these are necessary for better organized code

### Mystery Guest
- Let blocks tend to force devs to search for data
- Fixtures almost always are mystery guests

### Abstraction level disconnects
- Going from high level to low level. e.g. Checking css selector and then the database

## The power and perils of mocks and stubs
Doesn't test actual functionality

## Private methods: What do I test?
Test the public api implementation of the private method.
Abstract the method further into a public generic version
