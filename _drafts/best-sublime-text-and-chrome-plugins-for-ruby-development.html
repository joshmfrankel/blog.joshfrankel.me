<p>As part of the unofficial, yet soon to become official compilation series on getting started with Rails, this article will focus on another aspect of development: useful text editor and browser plugins. These are extensions I have used at some point and found to be highly effective and increasing productivity. This guide assumes that you are using Chrome and Sublime Text. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Chrome</h3>

<h4>Rails Panel</h4>
<p>I just recently discovered this plugin for Chrome and I can say without a doubt that it is easily one of the best methods for understanding what Rails is doing in the background. This plugin lays out everything for you that is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Here are a just few of its features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays all ActiveRecord queries</li>
  <li>Lists all views being rendered with duration</li>
  <li>Catches any debug logs from within the application</li>
  <li>Shows all page errors</li>
  <li>Elaborates on the breakdown of the url params for the page</li>
</ul>

<p>This plugin has been extremely helpful for me in understanding Rails application structure as well as tracking down pesky errors quicker.</p>

<p>To setup using Rails panel you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the Rails Panel extension in chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg?hl=en-US" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li>Add the gem to your gemfile <code>gem 'meta_request'</code>. (Preferably within a :development block)</li>
  <li>Run <code>bundle</code> in your app's directory to reload the gems</li>
  <li>Restart your rails server <code>(rails s)</code> and it should start catching application events</li>
</ol>
