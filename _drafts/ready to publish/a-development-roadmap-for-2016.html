<p>I recently read a blog post by Avdi Grimm about a setting realistic expectations for a programming language roadmap. As a developer, constantly learning new skills is a must. While there are a ton of interesting languages to learn, and I would love to learn them all, I had to be realistic and split them into a priority listing.</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
<p>So this is one I use daily for my professional work. Ruby on Rails is an amazing framework that has a ton of functionality and features built into it. With that said there are a ton of features I have never used or have never come upon the situation to use. Because of this some of my learning will be directed at learning some of these outlier features to help improve my overall understanding of the Rails ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>This might seem like a duplicate technology to learn based on the first entry, but as many before me I learned Ruby on Rails before really diving into just plain Ruby. With this section I have started going back to the basics of the language. I picked up the excellent book, "Eloquent Ruby" by Russ Olsen which so far is one of my favorite programming books I have ever read.</p>
<h3>React.js</h3>
<p>If you had to ask me which JavaScript library or framework to learn a few months ago I would have told you Angular.js or Ember.js. Both of which integrate nicely into Rails as well as other web frameworks. However, the community at large seems to be migrating towards utilizing React.js as a front-end for Rails applications. Not to mention awesome posts such as <a href="http://blog.arkency.com/rails-react/" target="_blank">these</a>.</p>
<h3>Elixir</h3>
<p>This was a tough one. There were a number of languages that were on my periphreal for this slot. I had been considering Haskell, Scala, or Rust (which I still may pick one up at some point).</p>
<p>The reason I decided on Elixir was three fold. Elixir has some very similiar syntax to ruby. I have heard more buzz and blogs about Elixir recently. One of my friends and I decided to learn a new language and Elixir was the one that overlapped on both of our lists.</p>
<h3>Phoenix</h3>
<p>This will be combined with my Elixir learning. Phoenix is the web framework that runs off of Elixir.</p>
<h3>Meteor.js</h3>
<p>A lot of companies have recently started leveraging Meteor.js. It is an awesome node framework that has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>Additionally, Node has become nearly ubiquitous in many job descriptions and seems it will continue for quite some time. The technology works well by itself and integrates nicely into other systems. Learning more about Meteor.js is a way for me to keep my knowledge level up with Node.js.</p>
