<p>Going from one programming language to another, there is a lot of knowledge that is easy to bring along. Theories, patterns, and general programming standards are pretty much universal across languages. However, syntax and process between two languages rarely looks the same.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Since I come from a background in PHP development, I find it easy to compare that knowledge with how rails accomplishes the same feats.</p>

<h3>Rails comes with awesome command line support</h3>
rails g
rails s
rails c

<h3>Everything is an object!</h3>

<h3>Tons of helpers</h3>

Line endings in PHP are

rails - implicit return or return
<h3>Variables</h3>

rails - variable =
<h3>Methods</h3>

<h3>Everything is an Object</h3>
