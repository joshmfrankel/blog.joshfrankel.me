... and in the darkness bind them.  Cheesy?  Yes.  Effective?  Maybe.

Let me start this article by first listing some of the best editors out there.  I've only listed editors that I have personally used.  Every ed    Depending on the project and the developer any of these can be powerful development tools.
<ul>
	<li>Wordpad - Simple built-in Windows editor.  One step above notepad</li>
	<li>Dreamweaver - Adobe's ide.  Great for beginners....just don't use the design mode.</li>
	<li>Eclipse - An awesome extendable ide that is best used with Java</li>
	<li>Netbeans - Based off of Eclipse Netbeans is leaner version that is one of my personal favorites for php development</li>
	<li>Notepad++ - An excellent bare bones editor with great features.</li>
	<li>Gedit - Simple, efficient, and has a robust plugin system.  A good substitute for textmate on Linux.</li>
	<li>CloudIDE - Great cloud based editor (hence the name)</li>
</ul>
<div>Though often what I find is the simplest solution is the best.  Sublime Text 2 fills this category perfectly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It has a clean interface, is lighting fast, and works with you, not against you.  Upon first load up the user settings are a little  different than most ide's as they are stored JSON style files.  This is a great paradigm shift as most editor's still employ the endless preference and setting menus.  With this shift also comes easier portability in the settings files.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Additionally, SF2 supports a robust package system courtesy of [insert github link].  This makes installing new packages a snap.</div>
