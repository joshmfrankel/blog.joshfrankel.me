<p>In the first issue of "Month in review", I will detail a few key topics. In the first section I will list any recent development news that I have come across. The next section will detail any notable gems, extensions, or app. Then in the last section I will list any blog posts from other developers which I have found helpful and informative.</p>

<h2>Dev News</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap 4 is in alpha (<a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li>
  <li>ElementaryOS released Freya (<a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notable gems, extensions, and apps</h2>

<h3>Foreman <small>gem</small></h3>
<p>Running the <strong>rails server, rspec, elasticsearch, mailcatcher, memcached, and fakes3</strong> at the same time can be quite annoying having to open six terminals. Luckily, <strong>foreman</strong> allows you to manage your app's processes in a <code>Procfile</code>. Once in the <code>Procfile</code> you can run everything from one terminal just by running <code>foreman start</code>.</p>

<h3>FactoryGirl <small>gem</small></h3>
<p>Dislike fixtures? If you do then <strong>FactoryGirl</strong> is for you as it provides dead simple factories for test data.</p>

<h3>Capybara <small>gem</small></h3>
<p>Capybara is an easy to use <strong>acceptance testing framework</strong> that integrates nicely with Rspec.</p>

<h3>Rubocop <small>gem</small></h3>
<p>Is your code a mess? Put <strong>Rubocop</strong> to work patroling your code. <strong>Rubocop</strong> enforces many of the community best practices of coding in Ruby. It also has a sublime plugin.</p>

<h3>Brew Bundler <small>extension</small></h3>
<p>If you are on Mac OSX a your application requires specific libraries for running in development you can utilize <strong>Brew Bundler</strong> as a way of managing different brew configurations on a per-project basis. Basically identical to how the ruby <code>gemfile</code> works</p>

<h3>MapTiler <small>app</small></h3>
<p>MapTiler provides a ton of custom mapping functionality in a simple to use app. Recently, I have used it on a personal project to overlay map markers onto a popular fantasy book series.</p>

<h3>Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm</h3>
<p><a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/" target="_blank">Mike Bostock's - Fisher-Yates Shuffle</a></p>
<p>I have been working on a node.js and socket.io card game in my free time and needed a proper way of shuffling a deck of cards. <strong>Mike Bostock's</strong> post is probably the best example of how to properly shuffle a deck of cards. He details the process from starting from a simple sorting algorithm up to implementing a full Fisher-Yates sorting algorithm. Additionally, he provides excellent interactive examples that show how the sort moves cards around.</p>

<h3>OOP Javascript</h3>
