<h2 id="1">Rails server pid</h2>
<code>A server is already running. Check /Users/jfrankel/Rails/sourcing/tmp/pids/server.pid.</code>
Sometimes rails server doesn't unlock its process id. Manually remove it to fix it.

<h2 id="2">Address already in use</h2>
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2015-10-03 14:00:40] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2015-10-03 14:00:40] INFO  ruby 2.2.1 (2015-02-26) [x86_64-darwin14]

/Users/jfrankel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/2.2.0/socket.rb:206:in `bind': Address already in use - bind(2) for 127.0.0.1:3000 (Errno::EADDRINUSE)

The port for your local development server is still being used by a ruby process. Assuming you are using the default port of 3000 run the following command to retrieve a list of all processes using the port.

lsof -wni tcp:3000

SHould get something like

COMMAND   PID     USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ruby    41704 jfrankel   12u  IPv6 0xf3fe9a8ff1e035b9      0t0  TCP [::1]:hbci (LISTEN)
ruby    41704 jfrankel   13u  IPv4 0xf3fe9a8ff6649a29      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:hbci (LISTEN)

Next just kill the process based on the pid.

kill -9 41704

<h2 id="3">Rails console gives errors in terminal after closing with Ctrl+c</h2>

Try using exit as it is the preferred method of stopping the session. For now just start a new terminal window.

<h2 id="4">Name Error</h2>
NameError at /awards/11
uninitialized constant User::NotificationSetting

These are much more straigh forward than they seem. You have mostly likely misnamed something or a class doesn't exist. Make sure to check if the constant needs to be plural or is misnamed. Check spelling

<h2 id="5">Cookie Error</h2>
MultiJson::ParseError at /login
Oj::ParseError

def preferences
  @_preferences ||= MultiJson.load(cookies["preferences_#{get_preference_group}"] || "{}")
end

Remove cookies for the website in your browser

<h2 id="6">LoadError expected something to define it</h2>
LoadError at /awards/11
Unable to autoload constant AwardSupplierNotificationSettings, expected /Users/jfrankel/Rails/sourcing/app/models/award_supplier_notification_settings.rb to define it

Basically this is similiar to the above NameError. This usually means that a class name is incorrectly typed.

<h2 id="7">PG::ObjectInUse: ERROR:  database "myapp_development" is being accessed by other users</h2>
Rake db:drop or other databse actions
PG::ObjectInUse: ERROR:  database "myapp_development" is being accessed by other users
DETAIL:  There is 1 other session using the database.
: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "myapp_development"

Make sure all connections to the database are closed
Make sure all pgsql admin connections are closed

<h2 id="8">Could not find [gem name] in any of the sources</h2>

Could not find in sources errors generally deal with the Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, improper bundler usage, or misconfigured installation.

1.Revert to a clean state in your repository
2.Remove minutest from Gemfile
3.Run bundle (not update)
4.Look in your Gemfile.lock and see what is depending upon minitest

Turn off all rails server and guard instances
rails g rspec:install
regenerate guard
remove Gemfile.lock
